# winhat
Running a RHEL development desktop farm on openShift

winhat is a container setup for running a red hat enterprise linux (RHEL) development desktop farm on openShift.
The desktop is accessed using X11, in our example from a Windows 10 client.

Example setup for C++/git/eclipse/mssql.
It can easily be adapted for other development settings.
